* The following automation features:
  * Auto Shield Counter from Block (by default/optionally on block release only)
  * Auto Shield Counter from Onslaught
  * Auto Shield Counter from Superleap
  * Auto Shield Counter from Wallop if Superleap cooldown
  * Auto Charging Lunge into Superleap when pressing unchained Superleap key (also integrating forceCancel functionality meaning you can essentially instant leap from any skill)

* forceCancel feature enabling the immediate start of any utility skill even when mid-skill (queueing used when necessary in rare cases).
* Silent Block feature allows block to initiate invisibly after a block release - you won't be locked in the block animation whilst continuing to block, which is cancelled upon movement or skill usage.

* Anti-bodyblock alternative that works universally.

* External ping method for more accurate ping values.
* Prevention of desync between boss model and boss’s position.
* Full control over all features and many additional configuration options.
* Adrenaline Rush & Guardian Shout skills ended upon a confirmed start of their respective mode.
